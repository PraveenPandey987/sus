        <p style={{ marginTop: "38px" }}>
          Ayush systems of medicine include Indian systems of medicine and
          Homoeopathy. Ayush is an acronym for Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy,
          Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy. Ayurveda is the oldest
          system with a documented history of its practice for more than 5000
          years whereas Homoeopathy is in practice in India for around 100
          years. These systems are being practised in the country with diverse
          preferences of people and infrastructural facilities.

        <h2 style={{ display: "inline" }}>AYURVEDA</h2>
        <p>
          Ayurveda, the science of life is one of the ancient and comprehensive
          systems of health care. Quest for good health and long life is
          probably as old as human existence. According to Indian philosophy,
          health is prerequisite to pursue materialistic, social and spiritual
          upliftment of human being. It is believed that Lord Brahma the creator
          of the universe was also the first preacher of Ayurveda. Four Vedas
          considered as oldest Indian literatures composed between 5000 and 1000
          BC have information on treatment by plants and natural procedures.
          Reference of medicine and surgery are also found in Indian epics like
          Ramayana and Mahabharata. However, Ayurveda was established as a fully
          grown medical system from the period of Samhita (compendium) i.e.,
          around 1000 BC. The compendia like Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita
          were written in a systematic manner with eight specialties during this
          period. In these treatises, the basic tenets and therapeutic
          techniques of Ayurveda got very much organized and enunciated. These
          treatises stressed the importance of maintenance of health and also
          expanded their vision to pharmaco-therapeutics. The therapeutic
          properties of plants, animal products and minerals were extensively
          described in these compendia, which has made Ayurveda a comprehensive
          system of health care.

        <h2 style={{ display: "inline" }}>YOGA</h2>
        <p>
          The word “Yoga” comes from the Sanskrit word “yuj” which means “to
          unite or integrate”. Yoga is about the union of a person’s own
          consciousness and the universal consciousness. It is primarily a way
          of life, first propounded by Maharishi Patanjali in systematic form
          Yogsutra. The discipline of Yoga consists of eight components namely,
          restraint (Yama), Observance of austerity (Niyama), physical postures
          (Asana), breathing control (Pranayam), restraining of sense organs
          (Pratyahar), contemplation (Dharna), meditation (Dhyan) and Deep
          meditation (Samadhi). These steps in the practice of Yoga have the
          potential to elevate social and personal behaviour and to promote
          physical health by better circulation of oxygenated blood in the body,
          restraining the sense organs and there by inducing tranquillity and
          serenity of mind and spirit. The practice of Yoga has also been found
          to the useful in the prevention of certain psychosomatic diseases and
          improves individual resistance and ability to endure stressful
          situations. Yoga is a promotive, preventive rehabilitative and
          curative intervention for overall enhancement of health status. A
          number of postures are described in Yoga literature to improve health,
          to prevent diseases and to cure illness. The physical postures are
          required to be chosen judiciously and have to be practiced in the
          correct way so that the benefits of prevention of disease, promotion
          of health and therapeutic use can be derived from them. The United
          Nations General Assembly had declared June 21st as the International
          Yoga Day on 11th December, 2014. Every year the Prime Minister of
          India, leads the nation in celebration of IDY.

        <h2 style={{ display: "inline" }}>Unani</h2>
        <p>
          Unani is a traditional system of medicine that originated in ancient
          Greece and later spread to the Middle East and South Asia. It is based
          on the teachings of Greek philosophers like Hippocrates and Galen.
          Unani medicine emphasizes the balance of bodily fluids (humors) and
          the use of natural substances, such as herbs and minerals, to maintain
          health and treat diseases. Practitioners of Unani medicine consider
          the body's natural healing processes and aim to restore harmony and
          balance for overall well-being.
        </p>
        <h2 style={{ display: "inline" }}>Siddha</h2>
        <p>
          Siddha is one of the ancient comprehensive medical systems in India.
          The Healing Dimension revealed by the Siddhars with highly
          systematized technology is 'Siddha medicine'. The evolution of Siddha
          system is believed to date back 10000 – 4000 BC. The Siddha system
          provides preventive, promotive, curative, rejuvenative and
          rehabilitative health care with holistic approach. The word ‘Siddha’
          is derived from the root word ‘Citti’, which means attaining
          perfection, heavenly bliss and accomplishment in life arts such as
          philosophy, yoga, wisdom, alchemy, medicine and above all the art of
          longevity. The Siddha system comprises essentially of philosophical
          concepts including the four main components: 1. Iatro-chemistry, 2.
          Medical practice, 3. Yogic practice and 4. Wisdom. Siddha system is
          named after the founders called ‘Siddhars’ who explored and explained
          the reality of nature and its relationship to man by their yogic
          awareness and experimental findings. Siddhar Agasthiyar is called the
          Father of Siddha Medicine. The Siddha diagnostic methodology is based
          on the clinical examination by the physician and these diagnostic
          tools are very important because they assist in diagnosis and
          prognosis of diseases. Siddha physicians base their diagnosis on three
          Humors (Mukkuttram) and eight vital tests (Ennvagai Thervu). The
          treatment in Siddha system is aimed at keeping the three vital life
          factors in equilibrium and in the maintenance of the seven body
          Thathus. Special therapies/external therapy techniques such as
          Pressure Manipulation Therapy (Varmam), Physical Manipulation Therapy
          (Thokkanam), Bone setting (Otivu Murivu Maruthuvam), Siddhar Yogam are
          strengths of Siddha system.

        <h2 style={{ display: "inline" }}>Sowa - Rigpa</h2>
        <p>
          “Sowa-Rigpa” commonly known as Amchi’s medicine, is the traditional
          medicine of many parts of the Himalayan regions. Sowa-Rigpa means
          Science of healing in Bodhi language. It is originated from the
          Bhagwan Buddha in India before 2500 years and plays vital role in
          public health in many Asian Countries. In India, Sowa-Rigpa is the
          traditional medicine in Himalayan regions of Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh,
          Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Darjeeling and Tibetan settlements of
          India. Considering the importance of Sowa-Rigpa and its active role in
          public health especially in Himalayan regions, Govt. of India has
          recognized the Sowa-Rigpa system of medicine by amendment to The
          Indian Medicine Central Council Act. 1970 in September 2010. Being
          originated from India, Sowa-Rigpa has large number of medical texts
          translated from India followed by a huge literature written by Tibetan
          scholars. As per the preliminary study conducted by National Research
          Institute for Sowa-Rigpa, Leh; there are 22 different Ayurvedic work
          in Buddhist cannon Stan-Gyur, written by well-known Indian scholars
          like Nagarjuna, Vagbhat, Chandrananda, Bha-Lipa etc. These are some of
          very important works of Ayurveda which were then popular in India.
          Most of these texts were translated during 8th–17th century AD by both
          Indian and Tibetan scholars. Non-canonical work like the fundamental
          text Gyud-bZi is believed to have had its source in Sanskrit too and
          believed to be scribed by Bhagwan Buddha. In the category of
          non-canonical works, there is a long list of medicinal text authored
          by different Indian and Tibetan scholars; many of these texts are
          available in form of gSung-bHum collection and Terma section. The
          number goes beyond two thousand. Most of these texts can be found in
          monasteries, Libraries, Amchi’s (Sowa-Rigpa practitioners). The Indian
          System of Medicine is of great lineage. It is the culmination of
          Indian thoughts of medicine which represents a way of healthy living
          valued with a long and unique cultural history and epitomizes the
          Vedic guidance ‘Let noble thoughts come to us from every side; thus,
          one can see an amalgamation of the of the best of influences that came
          in from the contact of different sources of knowledge.
        </p>
        <h2 style={{ display: "inline" }}>Homoeopathy</h2>
        <p>
          The physicians from the time of Hippocrates (around 400 B.C) have
          observed that certain substances could produce symptoms of disease in
          healthy people like those of people suffering from the disease. Dr.
          Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician
          scientifically examined this phenomenon and codified the fundamental
          principles of Homoeopathy. Homoeopathy was brought into India around
          1810 A.D by European missionaries and received official recognition by
          a Resolution passed by the Constituent Assembly in 1948 and then by
          the Parliament. The first principle of Homoeopathy ‘Similia Similibus
          Curentur’, says that a medicine which could induce a set of symptoms
          in healthy human beings would be capable of curing a similar set of
          symptoms in human beings suffering from the disease. The second
          principle of ‘Single Medicine’ says that one medicine should be
          administered at a time to a particular patient during the treatment.
          The third principle of ‘Minimum Dose’ stated that the bare minimum
          dose of a drug which would induce a curative action without any
          adverse effect should be administered. Homoeopathy is based on the
          theory that the causation of a disease mainly depends upon the
          susceptibility or proneness of an individual to the incidence of the
          disease in addition to the action of external agents like bacteria,
          viruses etc. Homoeopathy is a method of treating diseases by
          administering drugs which have been experimentally proved to possess
          the power to produce similar symptoms on healthy human beings.
          Treatment in Homoeopathy, which is holistic in nature, focuses on an
          individual’s response to a specific environment. Homoeopathic
          medicines are prepared mainly from natural substances, such as plant
          products, minerals and from animal sources, nososdes, sarcodes etc.
          Homoeopathic medicines do not have any toxic, poisonous, or side
          effects. Homoeopathic treatment is economical as well and has a very
          broad public acceptance. Homoeopathy has its own areas of strength in
          therapeutics, and it is particularly useful in treatment for
          allergies, autoimmune disorders and viral infections. Many surgical,
          gynaecological & obstetrical and paediatric conditions and ailments
          affecting the eyes, nose, ear, teeth, skin, sexual organs etc. are
          amenable to Homoeopathic treatment. Behavioural disorder, Neurological
          problems and Metabolic diseases can also be successfully treated by
          Homoeopathy. Apart from the curative aspects, Homoeopathic medicines
          are also used in preventive and promotive healthcare. In recent times,
          there is an emergence of interest in the use of Homoeopathic medicines
          in veterinary care, agriculture, dentistry etc. Homoeopathic medical
          education has developed in seven specialties in post-graduate
          teaching, which are Materia Medica, Organon of Medicine, Repertory,
          Practice of Medicine, Paediatric, Pharmacy and Psychiatry.

        <h2>Why AYUSH ?</h2>
        <p style={{marginTop : "41px"}}>
          Why Ayush Advantages of ayurveda Comprehensive definition of health: -
          Ayurveda defines health as a state of equilibrium of Dosa (regulatory
          and functional entities of the body), Dhatu (structural entities),
          Mala (excretory entities) and Agni (digestive and metabolic factors)
          along with healthy state of sensory and motor organs and mind with
          their harmonious relationship with the soul. As against definition of
          health, the diseased state is defined in Ayurveda as a loss of
          equilibrium of essential body constituents. The objective of disease
          management is to bring back the equilibrium, principally through
          lifestyle management rather than through curative therapies. The
          strength of Ayurveda lies in its three-fold holistic approach of
          prevention of disease, promotion of health and cure of disease. This
          is achieved through care of body, mind and soul where physical, mental
          and spiritual aspects of health are considered. Acceptance by the
          community: - About 80-90% of population in India is reported to use
          Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicine to meet their
          primary health care needs. Safety of this system is attributed to
          time-tested use substantiated by scientific evidence. Besides, synergy
          of ingredients in conjunction with individual need-based treatment
          plan forms the basis of efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic formulations.
          Specific guidelines are prescribed for the use of apparently toxic
          medicinal plants with certain detoxification processing that also
          enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of the final product.
          Emphasis on promotion of health and prevention of diseases: -
          Considering health of an individual as dynamic integration of
          environment, body, mind and soul, Ayurveda lays great emphasis on
          preservation and promotion of health and preventing the occurrence of
          diseases. The treatment modalities of Ayurveda are based on the
          inherent ability of the living body to rejuvenate, regenerate and
          restore the natural equilibrium. While treating the patient, Ayurvedic
          treatment helps to enhance the natural healing process in the body.
          The prevention of disease and promotion of health is achieved by
          judicious practice of Dinacarya (daily regimen), Ritucarya (seasonal
          regimen) and Sadvritta (ethical code of conduct) in accordance with
          Prakrti (psychosomatic constitution). In this way significance of
          healthy lifestyle for maintenance of health is emphasized by Ayurveda.
          Do's and don'ts on personal and social behavior are elaborated for
          attaining total health. Great emphasis is given on Nidana Parivaijana
          i.e., keeping away from factors which cause or precipitate the
          disease, whereas therapeutic procedures like Panchkarma help in
          eradicating the disease. Importance of diet and lifestyle: - The
          ultimate aim of this medical science is preservation of health, and it
          can be attained in two ways, i.e., observation of lifestyle
          recommendations to prevent the diseases and eradication of already
          afflicted diseases. The prerequisites to attain the prevention include
          wholesome diet, conservation of environment, congenial social and
          cultural atmosphere. Diet is an essential factor for the maintenance
          of health. Ayurveda emphasizes on diversified aspects of dietetics and
          nutrition viz. quality, quantity, processing methods, rationale of
          combination of food articles, emotional aspects, nature of the
          consumer, geographical and environmental conditions etc. Advocacy of
          proper diet and lifestyle, which is congenial to the individual
          maintains normal body functions thus prevents the diseases. Holistic
          concept of health: - Ayurveda considers a living being as a
          combination of body, mind and soul. All health management approaches
          are intended to maintain the harmony and homeostasis of these
          entities. Individualized approach: - Ayurveda considers that everyone
          has distinct psychosomatic constitution and health status. This is
          considered while advocating preventive, promotive and curative
          measures. Universal approach: - According to Ayurveda, the individual
          (microcosm) is a miniature replica of the universe (macrocosm). Every
          aspect of the universe is represented in the individual. Any change in
          the environment affects human being. Therefore, emphasis is laid on
          social and environmental factors which are interlinked with health.
          Stress on public health and eugenics: - The activities of the
          individual through his thought, word and deed have their good or bad
          effects on the environment. Ayurveda emphasizes upon healthy body,
          sound mind, benevolent speech and spiritual practices to create a
          healthy and happy environment. The pivotal role of eugenics mentioned
          in Ayurveda is to produce strong, healthy and ideal progeny. Use of
          natural products: - Ayurvedic products are derived mainly from plants
          and other natural resources. Supportive leads are emerging from
          revalidation of Ayurvedic drugs. Identification of active principles
          of some plants has led to discovery of many allopathic drugs. Some
          pharmacologically proven constituents of the Ayurvedic plants like
          Aloe vera, Curcuma longa, withania somnifera, Bacopa monnieri etc. are
          used globally. Areas of clinical strength: - Ayurveda provides
          healthcare within the physical and financial reach of rural India.
          Some of the Ayurvedic medicinal plants and spices are widely used as
          home remedies in India for a wide range of common ailments. The common
          users of Ayurveda are individuals suffering from chronic intractable
          diseases. Ayurvedic treatment is effective in chronic disorders like
          sinusitis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity; psychosomatic
          disorders like depression, insomnia; digestive disorders like
          irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcer, inflammatory bowel
          diseases; respiratory disorders like bronchial asthma and chronic
          obstructive pulmonary disease; Musculo-skeletal disorders like
          arthritis, osteoporosis; neurological and neuro-degenerative disorders
          like paralytic conditions, sciatica, dementia, Parkinson's disease
          etc. Unique therapeutic approach: - Ayurveda advocates certain
          bio-cleansing and rejuvenating therapeutic measures such as
          Pahcakarma, Rasayana for maintenance of healthy state as well as in
          the management of chronic diseases. Ksarasutra, a minimal invasive
          para-surgical procedure using medicated thread, widely cited in
          ancient medical literatures for its safety and efficacy is being
          successfully practiced as promising therapy for ano-rectal disorders.
          Such unique specialties of Ayurveda either as stand-alone or add on
          therapies are proven to have an edge over conventional medical
          approach in disease management and improving quality of life. The way
          forward: - Ayurveda can contribute to the management of chronic and
          refractory disease conditions sharing huge global burden such as
          cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and allied conditions.
